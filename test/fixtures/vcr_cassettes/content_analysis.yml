        Claw Back","htmlBody":"Stocks reversed losses and inched higher, after elections
        in France and Greece fueled concerns about the region''s ability to deal with
        its sovereign-debt problems. Stocks opened lower but recovered most losses
        by Monday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10 points, or 0.1%,
        to 13048. The Dow industrials fell as much as 68 points early in the session.
        The Standard & Poor''s 500-stock index rose four points, or 0.3%, to 1373,
        and the Nasdaq Composite rose 13 points, 0.4%, to 2969. Vincent Cignarella
        and Michael Casey join Markets Hub with the U.S. reaction to weekend elections
        in France and Greece, and what the new order will mean for the continent''s
        debt struggles. Financial-sector stocks rose the most, with Bank of America
        CVX -0.31% leading Dow components. Utility stocks trailed behind. Walt Disney
        DIS +1.93% rose after its latest superhero action film, ''The Avengers,''
        raked in over $200 million in its weekend box-office debut. Strong ticket
        sales validated Disney''s $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment and
        softened the blow of the recently disappointing ''John Carter.'' American
        International Group AIG -3.37% slumped after the U.S. government agreed to
        sell $5 billion of the insurer''s stock at $30.50 a share, representing a
        7.1% discount to Friday''s closing price. Weekend elections across the Atlantic
        initially jostled markets.","targetedKeyword":"stocks","domain":"http://online.wsj.com"}'
